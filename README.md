# Covid19-Tracker

Tracks daily cases for Ireland and the world using the covid19 API: _https://covid19api.com/_

Allows the user to specify what country they want to see and what category they want to see: Cases, Recoveries or Deaths

**Will be adding new parts soon

**Works well for Ireland, does not work well for a country like the UK or USA with multiple different provences and
territories. Will fix this though
